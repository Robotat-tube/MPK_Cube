# Megaminx Human Solution
Gruppe 3: Abdank, Baghdadi, Scheucher, Schillhammer, Wiesm√ºller


### How to Start: 
- navigate to your /Megaminx Human Algorithm Folder
- <megaminx_algorithm.pl> <megaminx_goals.pl> <megaminx_rotations.pl> Algorithm files
- <mytest.pl> different Test cases with up to 55 Rotatations 
- swipl.exe .\megaminx_algorithm.pl .\megaminx_goals.pl .\megaminx_rotations.pl .\mytest.pl

### Output: 
- Solving time: 55 Rotations in ~23min
- Console output shows each Stage with the needed rotation to solve the cube
- Final output: all moves from scrambled to finished/solved

### Special Moves: 
- Each new "Goal-Group" introduces a new Special-Move
- Each Speacial-Move is used to get to the next "Goal-Group" of the Human solution
